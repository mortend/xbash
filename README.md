> Friendly, portable wrapper around `bash`.

The wrapper is used to run shell-scripts in various [node-powered applications](https://github.com/fuse-open/uno). The wrapper makes sure that also `curl` and `unzip` are available inside `bash`, as needed by some [cross-platform installers](https://github.com/fuse-open/android-build-tools).

* On Windows, the wrapper finds your [Git for Windows] installation and will prefer to run commands from there.

* If a [Git for Windows] installation isn't found, and the commands aren't otherwise found, the wrapper will provide instructions on how to install [Git for Windows].

[Git for Windows]: https://git-scm.com/downloads

## Install

```
npm install xbash
```

This will install `bash` (alias `xbash`), a cross-platform wrapper around the real `bash` executable.

## Usage

This package gives you a reasonably portable way to use `bash` and other tools â€“ in JavaScript or from command-line.

### JavaScript

```js
const bash = require('xbash');

bash(['-c', 'echo Hello World!'], process.exit);
```

### Command-Line

```
$ bash --version

ERROR: 'bash' was not found. This can be solved by installing Git.

Please get Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads and try again.
```

This happens when `bash` was not found. Running again after installing [Git for Windows].

```
$ bash --version
